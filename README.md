# Auto-SRE-Agent

## Project Overview
This project simulates a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) agent. It demonstrates how an automated system can detect and diagnose issues within a software application.

The system consists of two main parts:
1.  Simulator: A component that intentionally introduces faults, such as database crashes or memory leaks, into a dummy application.
2.  SRE Agent: An intelligent agent that monitors logs and metrics to identify these faults and generate an incident report.

## Project Structure

### Simulator (simulator/)
Contains the code for the simulated application and the fault injection mechanism.
*   chaos_monkey.py: The script that runs the application and injects errors.
*   scenarios.py: Defines the different error scenarios, such as database connection failures or memory leaks.

### Agent (sre_agent/)
Contains the logic for the SRE agent.
*   main.py: The entry point for the agent.
*   agent.py: The core logic that gathers data and coordinates analysis.
*   llm.py: A simulated Large Language Model client. In a production environment, this would connect to an external AI service. Here, it uses keyword matching to demonstrate functionality without API keys.

### Data (var/)
Stores runtime data and output files.
*   logs/app.log: Application logs generated by the simulator.
*   metrics.json: System metrics like CPU and memory usage.
*   report.md: The incident report generated by the agent.

## Usage

### 1. Run the Simulator
To start the application and simulate a failure, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
python3 -m simulator.chaos_monkey --scenario db_crash
```

### 2. Run the Agent
In a separate terminal window, run the agent to analyze the situation:

```bash
python3 -m sre_agent.main
```

The agent will analyze the logs and generate a report in var/report.md.
